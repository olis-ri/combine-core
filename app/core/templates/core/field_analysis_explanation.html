        <p>In Combine, Records undergo a processing of <span class="font-weight-bold">mapping</span> to extract discrete
            metadata fields from their original XML record for analysis and comparison across Records. Mapping is
            performed by flattening the Record's XML document into field names that still retain semantic hints as to
            what XML fields they pertain too. This mapping can be configured (and configurations saved) for each Job, <a

                about that here</a>.</p>

        <p>The following describes the columns in the larger table below, which is populated by Records as mapped to
            fields and stored in ElasticSearch. They can provide insights into outlier Records that may not have a
            particular field, or provide a method to view all values of a particular mapped field.</p>
